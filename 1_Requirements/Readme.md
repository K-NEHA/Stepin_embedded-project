                                                     SEAT HEATING APPLICATION
                                                     ========================

Seat Heating App:-
==================

--> This project name is Seat Heating Application.
--> In this project we are designing a car seat heater using a microcontroller.
--> For that we are doing 4 activities.
--> Below are the 4 activities regarding this App.
 
 ACTIVITY-1:-
 ============
 
---> In Activity-1, we are connecting 2 buttons for ATMega328.
---> In that 2 buttons - Button1 sensor is used to say whether the passenger is seated or not.
---> Then, Led Actuator shows the driver is seated.
---> Another one  Button 2 is heater button which is used to detect the heat.
---> Then, Heater will check the heater button is ON.

ACTIVITY-2:-
============

---> In Activity-2, we got the detected temperature.
---> we can increase or decrease the temperature by using switch or a button.
---> we can set it to either minimum values or maximum values.
---> Example: In the range of (20%-33%)
     ========
---> we need to get ADC.

ACTIVITY-3:
=========
---> In Activity-3, it displays the value of temperature as output.
---> Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM.

ACTIVITY-4:
==========
---> In Activity-4, It is displaying the temperature(USART).
